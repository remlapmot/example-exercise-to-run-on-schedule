```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(include = params$solutions)
```

1. This is question 1. Which might have some R code you always want to show.

   ```{r, include=TRUE}
   # example code for the question
   ```

   ```{asis}
   Paragraph text for the solution can be kept in the document in an `asis` chunk.
   And solution R code in an `r` chunk.
   Both of these will use the `include` value from the `setup` chunk.
   ```
    
   ```{r}
   # Example code for the solution
   ```

2. This is question 2.

`r if (params$solutions) "<details>"`
`r if (params$solutions) "<summary>Session info</summary>"`
```{r}
quarto::quarto_version()
sessioninfo::session_info()
```
`r if (params$solutions) "</details>"`
